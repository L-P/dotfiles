dotfiles
========

What?
-----
Those are my 'dotfiles', my personal configuration files for the things I use
all day for work or pleasure: my shells and my text editor.
This repository also contains some little scripts that had a purpose at some
point or still have one, open-sourced for the sake of it.

Why?
----
Sharing is caring.

How?
----
My configuration was made empirically, when I need something, feel that
something could be easier or when I see something nice on the internets, I put
it in there and see if it's really useful (it won't stay if it's not).

Quick install
-------------
I'm a lazy man so I made a [script to make a script that installs everything](https://github.com/L-P/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/make_installer.sh).
This script requires `git` and the `makeself` package to be present.

**Warning**: the resulting `dotfiles.run` script will remove all the dotfiles
from your home folder, use it at your own risk.
